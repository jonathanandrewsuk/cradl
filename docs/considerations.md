# Considerations & Open Questions

* Which unit tests can be carried over from the V1 version and what will be new in a microservices model?

* Does it make sense to release endpoints to production as they are developed? or do we need to release in groups?

* Documentation needs to be created for the following use cases:
    * A new user, using the API products only
    * A new user, using the V2 out-of-the-box solution
    * A existing V1 user, looking to migrate to V2 API products only

* Should we develop a front end component library to be used with the API?
